# Multiclassification
A multilayer perceptron neural network used to classify three or more labels through gene expression implemented in PyTorch. 

This project takes two input files, a gene expression matrix (GEM) and text file which lists the correct labels in one column. The GEM is transposed to allign to with the label file, 80% of the samples are used to train the neural network, and then the network is tested with the last 20% of samples.
